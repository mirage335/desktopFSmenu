XDG specification leaves considerations of efficient, consistent categorization and file associations in the hands of individual application developers. Worse, editing tools like "KMenuEdit" and "Alacarte" do not seem to readily offer mass-editing functionality. Finally, categories are defined solely by text fileds, making exploration at the filesystem layer difficult. Disaster.

Here, the default pool is banished to unreadability by chmod, and the pool of new application shortcuts is built from more orderly information sources. Relief.

_Usage_
Launch the "desktopMenuInstaller" script in a directory containing a hiearchy of ".directory" and ".desktop" files, with ".root" at the top-level directory. An example "menu" directory is provided.
